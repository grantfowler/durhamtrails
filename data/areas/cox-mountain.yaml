  The most rugged section of Eno River State Park, and one of the richest in history.
  Located at a strategic corridor between Durham and Hillsborough, Cox Mountain sits
  near several historic fords — Fanny's Ford, Few's Ford, and Cates Ford — where the
  Fish Dam Road and the old Durham-Hillsborough Coach Road once crossed the Eno.
  Old roadbeds, mill ruins, stone foundations, and even abandoned cars hide in these
  woods, layered over centuries of use by Native Americans, colonial settlers, and
  19th-century industry. Home to the challenging Cox Mountain loop, extensive
  unofficial trail networks, and access to backcountry camping.

history: >
  Cox Mountain's trails follow paths shaped by geology and economics over centuries.
  The Eno's shallow crossings here — Few's Ford, Fanny's Ford, Cates Ford — made this
  a natural corridor long before European settlement. Native Americans established the
  Fish Dam Road through here as a trading path. Colonial settlers built mills to harness
  the creek water (Holden's Mill, William Few's Mill c.1758), which attracted roads,
  which attracted settlement. The Piper-Cox House and surrounding structures are remnants
  of that era. Today's trails — both official and unofficial — are desire paths that
  reveal this layered history.
