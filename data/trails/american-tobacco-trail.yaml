description: >
  Durham's flagship rail-trail, running 22 miles from the Durham Bulls
  Athletic Park downtown to the Chatham County line. Mostly paved, with
  a crushed stone section south of I-40. Flat and accessible — great
  for walking, running, and cycling. Connects to the broader Triangle
  greenway network.

notes: >
  The unpaved section south of I-40 can be muddy after rain. The I-40
  crossing uses an at-grade road crossing — use caution.
