description: >
  22-mile rail trail running from downtown Durham south to the Chatham
  County line. Built on a former railroad corridor, the paved multi-use
  path passes through urban, suburban, and rural landscapes.
notes: >
  The trail has a gap at I-40 that requires a brief road detour.
  The southern unpaved section is gravel and can be muddy after rain.
