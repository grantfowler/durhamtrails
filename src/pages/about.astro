        Durham Trails is a comprehensive guide to hiking trails in and around Durham, North Carolina. 
        Our goal is simple: be the most useful, complete, and up-to-date source for trail information 
        in the Durham area.

      <h2 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-3">Why This Exists</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700">
        Durham has incredible hiking — from the Eno River gorges to Duke Forest's fire roads to 
        the greenways connecting it all. But finding good trail information has always been harder 
        than it should be. Official park maps are incomplete, trail apps don't know about the 
        social trails, and the best local knowledge lives in people's heads or scattered Reddit threads.
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-700">
        This site aims to fix that. We include official trails, unofficial social trails, 
        fire roads, greenways, and the connectors between them — everything a hiker, runner, 
        or dog walker needs to explore Durham's outdoors.

      <h2 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-stone-800 mt-8 mb-3">Trail Data</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-700">
        Trail geometry comes from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" class="text-forest-700 underline">OpenStreetMap</a> 
        contributors, supplemented with GPS data from local hikers. Trail descriptions, history notes, 
        and local knowledge come from years of running and hiking these trails.
